    <h1>Christian Tisby</h1>
    <h2>Software Developer</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am working hard to learn how to program, I have experience with
        iOS and Android development.  
    </p>
    <h3>Areas of Focus</h3>
    <p>I need to focus on the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Swift</li>
        <li>Kotlin</li>
        <li>iOS Development</li>
        <li>Android Development</li>
        <li>Javascript and Web Development</li>
        <li>Golang for Backend Development</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I sort of have a plan to tackle all of this, I would like to have addressed
        each topic and understand it fluently by the end of 2023.
        In each topic listed above, I only have a semi understanding.  I'm working
        to change that.  With the Lord's help and my focus, I'll make it happen.
    </p>

    <h3>Should I focus on freelance work?</h3>
    <p>Here's the thing, I want to work for <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>.  However, 
    their interview process is tough!  But, it's not so tough that it can't be done.
    Again, with the Lord's help and some focus I can do it.  I will work on
    making this a reality.  Hopefully I can work remotely.</p>
    <p>I will attempt to work on freelancing as well for a side hustle.</p>
    <p>1/3/2023 That's all for now!</p>
